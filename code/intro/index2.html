        1. The var keyword was used in all Javascript code from 1995 to 2015.
        2. The let and const keywords were added to Javascript in 2015.
        3. The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browser.
        When to use var, let, or const?
        1. Use const if the value and type should not be changed.
        2. use let if you MUST support old browsers & can't use const.
        let & const are used to declare a block.
